# bank-simulation
Overview
This project simulates basic **banking operations** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java.  
It demonstrates the use of:
  Classes & Objects  
  Inheritance  
  Method Overriding  
  Encapsulation

 Key Concepts Used
 **Inheritance:** `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` inherit from the base `Account` class.
 **Encapsulation:** Balance and transaction details are protected within the class.
 **Method Overriding:** `withdraw()` is overridden in `CurrentAccount` to allow overdraft.
 **Polymorphism:** Dynamic method invocation is used for account actions.
 **Constructor Overloading:** Used to initialize account details.
